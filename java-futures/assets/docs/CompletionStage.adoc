== What is CompletionStage

Introduced in Java 8 (2014).

A link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletionStage.html[`java.util.concurrent.CompletionState`] interface represents an asynchronous or synchronous computation task.

This task performs an action or computes a value when another CompletionStage completes.

There are a few classifications that are identifiable via patterns in the method's name.

== Classifications

=== Core methods

Types of computation determined by method name pattern

.Core Methods
[width="99%", options="header"]
|===
|Pattern in method name |Description

|`*apply/Apply*`|https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Function.html[Function] computation on result or value of the CompletionStage
|`*accept/Accept*`|https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Consumer.html[Consumer] computation on result or value of the CompletionStage
|`*run/Run*`|https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runnable.html[Runnable] computation
|===

=== Action methods

Actions performed determined by method name pattern

.Action methods
[width="99%", options="header"]
|===
|Pattern in method name |Description

|`*Compose*`|Similar to apply, returns a new CompletionStage after the completion of the current one, thus allowing pipelines
|`*Combine*`|Combine results of two completion stages into a BiFunction and returns a new CompletionStage
|`*exceptionally*`|handle any exception via a Function that returns a CompletedStage, successful completion is returned as the value of CompletionStage
|`*whenComplete*`|handle  either successful result or exception passed as a BiConsumer and returns a new CompletionStage
|`*handle*`|handle either successful result or exception passed as a BiFunction and returns a new CompletionStage
|===

=== Synchronicity

Synchronicity of the stage is either Sync or Async

.Synchronicity
[width="99%", options="header"]
|===
|Pattern in method name |Description

|*<nothing>*|synchronous
|`*Async*`|asynchronous
|===

=== Post Execution

Actions to perform post-execution

.Post Execution
[width="99%", options="header"]
|===
|Pattern in method name |Description

|`*then*`|a single stage
|`*Both*`|both of two stages
|`*Either*`|either of two stages
