== What is a CompletableFuture

Introduced in Java 8 (2014).

A link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`] is a complete implementation of *both* `Future` and `CompletionStage`.

CompletableFuture provides static methods as means to execute the tasks.

CompletableFuture allows for chaining and combining outcomes from multiple other CompletableFutures.

== Classifications

.Operations return type
[width="99%", options="header"]
|===
|Pattern in method name |Description

|`*run/Run*`|Perform a task without a return value, using a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runnable.html[Runnable].
|`*supply/Supply*`|Perform a task that returns a value, using a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Supplier.html[Supplier].

=== Synchronicity

Synchronicity is either Sync or Async

.Synchronicity
[width="99%", options="header"]
|===
|Pattern in method name |Description

|*<nothing>*| *_synchronous_*, performed by the thread running the CompletableFuture.
|`*Async*`| *_asynchronous_*, performed by default by the ForkJoinPool.commonPool unless an executor is provided.
|===

=== Results

There are two methods to retrieve the results.

Both *_wait for the CompletableFuture to complete_*, then return the result if successful.

Unsuccessful outcomes are due to cancellation, exceptional outcomes and interruptions.

.Results
[width="99%", options="header"]
|===
|Method name |Description

|`*get*`|Return the result. Throws *_checked exceptions_* when unsuccessful.
|`*join*`|Return the result. Throws *_unchecked runtime exceptions_* when unsuccessful.
|===

=== Multiple CompletableFutures

.Chaining and Combining
[width="99%", options="header"]
|===
|Pattern in method name |Description

2+| Chaining
|`*thenCompose**`| Chain two CompletableFuture, the second executed *_after_* the first using the result of the first as a value in a Function, *_returning a CompletableFuture_*.
|`*thenCombine**`| Chain two CompletableFuture, *_when both are completed_* using the result of both as values in a BiFunction, *_returning a CompletableFuture_*.
2+| Combining All
|`*thenAcceptBoth**`| Chain two CompletableFuture, *_when both are completed_* using the result of both as values in a BiConsumer, *_returning a value_*.
|`*runAfterBoth**`| Chain two CompletableFuture, *_when both are completed_* run a Runnable, *_returning a CompletableFuture<Void>_*.
|`*allOf*`| Await the completion of *_all of_* a list of CompletableFuture instances, *_returning a CompletableFuture<Void>_*.
2+| Combining Either
|`*applyToEither**`| Accept the completion of the current or other CompletableFuture using the value in a Function, *_returning a CompletableFuture_*.
|`*acceptEither**`| Accept the completion of the current or other CompletableFuture using the value in a Consumer, *_returning a CompletableFuture_*.
|`*runAfterEither**`| Accept the completion of the current or other CompletableFuture, then run a Runnable, *_returning a CompletableFuture<Void>_*.
|`*anyOf*`| Await the completion of *_any one of_* a list of CompletableFuture instances, *_returning a CompletableFuture<Object>_*.

== Understanding Pipelines in CompletableFuture

CompletionFuture has Stages.

Each Stage may produce an output or signal when completed successfully.
Any stage can fail, leading to an exception. The exception can be handled.
A handling of an exception may cause the pipeline to be repaired or may be fatal enough to fail.
